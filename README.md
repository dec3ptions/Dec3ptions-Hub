# Dec3ptions Hub

Thank you for choosing Dec3ptions Hub, I appreciate all support from anyone. I made this script for the purpose of ultimate performance and monitoring while auto farming in Fisch. I found that other scripts make the game more unresponsive as time goes on, but my script does not slow down even after 40hr+ testing.

## Features

These descriptions will help you understand what each of the settings do.

* RenderingEnabled - Disabling this will intermittently pause and unpause your game from rendering. It is perfect for long grinds, as GPU usage drops to 0% as opposed to 10+%.

* PerformanceBlackScreen - Enabling this will add a black overlay to your screen. This is useful for keeping your monitor dark while on in order to auto farm. Unofficial sources have also stated that this may pause game rendering as well, but it is not confirmed at all.

* DecalsEnabled - Disabling this will remove all decals from the game. This is a performance setting.

* ShadowsEnabled - Disabling this will remove all shadows from the game. This is a performance setting.

* AutoShakeDelay - This controls how often it attempts to click the shake button while fishing. Anywhere between 0.02 and 0.2 is optimal.

* FreezeCharacter - Enabling this will lock your character in place completely, which is perfect as many things would normally slightly move you over time.

* TeleportLocation - By picking one of the options listed further down, you will be teleported and rotated into the auto farming location selected. This option is not cap-sensitive.

* Webhook - By pasting a discord webhook URL into this, you will recieve detailed statistics on how the auto farm is performing, even including an hourly projection.

* WebhookUpdateDelay - This controls how often you will receive these statistics. It is measured in seconds.

### Teleport Locations

All of the currently working locations are listed below, more will be added ASAP. Remember, if you do not enter a location or type nil in the field, it will simply not teleport you and will begin from where you are.

```
"Brine pool"
"The depths"
```
